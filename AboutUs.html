        <p>Founded in 2024 in East Lansing Michigan by Gabrielle Berger </p>
        <p>"My journey began in a web development class right before graduation, where a project sparked my deep interest in ocean plastics and their devastating impact on our planet. I dove more into learning about ocean plastics, I was both heartbroken and motivated by what I learned about current efforts, and more importantly what still needs to be done."
        </p>
        <p>"From the start I knew there was no one size fits all answer and questioned if I could really make a difference but while thinking about that, I realized that while I alone may not make a huge difference on the ocean pollution problem because I only hold 1% of the solution. While one person may not solve the problem, every individual who is willing to take action plays a crucial part. We all hold a part of the solution we just have to work together to solve the problem." </p>
        <p>"So thats what I did. I set out to build something greater, a network of passionate individuals, each volunteering their time and energy to tackle the plastic pollution crisis. Watching this community come together  has been one of the most inspiring experiences in my life to watch. It is clear now that, while no one person has all the answers, collectively we are capable of creating a wave of change."</p>
        <p>Today we have over 300 volunteers all across the Unted States that have cleaned a total of 17.5 tons of plastic from waterways small and large. We are looking to expand worldwide. Consider joining our team! Wherever you are, whenever you can help, you are part of the solution. Help us fight for change. Be a part of the Wave of Change.
